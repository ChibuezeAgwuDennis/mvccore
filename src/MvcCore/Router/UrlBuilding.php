	 * Generates url:
	 * - By `"Controller:Action"` name and params array
	 *   (for routes configuration when routes array has keys with `"Controller:Action"` strings
	 *   and routes has not controller name and action name defined inside).
	 * - By route name and params array
	 *	 (route name is key in routes configuration array, should be any string,
	 *	 routes must have information about controller name and action name inside).
	 * Result address (url string) should have two forms:
	 * - Nice rewritten URL by routes configuration
	 *   (for apps with URL rewrite support (Apache `.htaccess` or IIS URL rewrite module)
	 *   and when first param is key in routes configuration array).
	 * - For all other cases is URL form like: `"index.php?controller=ctrlName&amp;action=actionName"`
	 *	 (when first param is not founded in routes configuration array).
	 * Method tries to find any route between routes by first argument and if
	 * there is no route but if there is any pre route URL building handler defined,
	 * the handler is called to assign desired routes from database or any other place
	 * and then there is processed route search between routes again. If there is 
	 * still no routes, result url is completed in query string form.
	 * @param string $controllerActionOrRouteName	Should be `"Controller:Action"` combination or just any route name as custom specific string.
	 * @param array  $params						Optional, array with params, key is param name, value is param value.
	 * @throws \InvalidArgumentException
	 * @return string
