/**
 * Responsibility - describing request(s) to match and reversely build url addresses.
 * - Describing request to match it (read more about properties).
 * - Matching request by given request object, see `\MvcCore\Route::Matches()`.
 * - Completing url address by given params array, see `\MvcCore\Route::Url()`.
 *
 * Main Properties:
 * - `$Pattern`
 *   Required, if you have not configured `\MvcCore\Route::$Match` and
 *   `\MvcCore\Route::$Reverse` property instead. Very basic URL address
 *   form to match and parse rewrited params by it. Address to parse
 *   and prepare `\MvcCore\Route::$Match` property and `\MvcCore\Route::$Reverse`
 *   property. automaticly in `\MvcCore\Route::Prepare();` call.
 * - `$Match`
 *   Required together with `\MvcCore\Route::$Reverse` property, if you
 *   have not configured `\MvcCore\Route::$Pattern` property instead.
 *   This property is always used to match request by `\MvcCore\Request::Path`
 *   by classic PHP regualar expression matching by `preg_match_all();`.
 * - `$Reverse`
 *   Required together with `\MvcCore\Route::$Match` property, if you
 *   have not configured `\MvcCore\Route::$Pattern` property instead.
 *   This property is always used to complete url address by called params
 *   array and by this string with rewrite params replacements inside.
 * - `$Controller`
 *   Required, if there is no `controller` param inside `\MvcCore\Route::$Pattern`
 *   or inside `\MvcCore\Route::$Match property`. Controller class name to dispatch
 *   in pascal case form, namespaces and including slashes as namespace delimiters.
 * - `$Action`
 *   Required, if there is no `action` param inside `\MvcCore\Route::$Pattern`
 *   or inside `\MvcCore\Route::$Match property`. Public method in controller
 *   in pascal case form, but in controller named as `public function <CoolName>Action () {...`.
 * - `$Name`
 *   Not required, if you want to create url addresses always by `Controller:Action`
 *   named records. It could be any string, representing route custom name to
 *   complete url address by that name inside your application.
 * - `$Defaults`
 *   Not required, matched route params default values and query params default values.
 *   Last entry in array may be used for property `\MvcCore\Route::$LastPatternParam`
 *   describing last rewrited param inside match pattern to be automaticly trimmed
 *   from right side for possible address trailing slash in route matched moment.
 * - `$Constraints`
 *   not required, array with param names and their custom regular expression
 *   matching rules. If no constraint string for any param defined, there is used
 *   for all rewrited params default constraint rule to match everything except next slash.
 *   Default static property for matching rule shoud be changed here:
 *   - by default: `\MvcCore\Route::$DefaultConstraint = '[^/]*';`

	 * - No escaping of regular expression characters:
